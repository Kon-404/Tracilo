# Kryohm Professional Website Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Generate 50+ qualified leads per month within 6 months through strategic lead capture and conversion optimization
- Establish Kryohm as a credible IoT solution provider in target regions (South Africa, Namibia, Zambia)
- Create a professional web presence that effectively showcases three distinct product lines (Sensors, Prepaid Metering, Shower Control)
- Provide sales team with quality digital collateral and lead qualification tools
- Achieve 3%+ conversion rate from visitor to lead within first quarter
- Build technical credibility through authentic product imagery and detailed specifications
- Enable easy prospect engagement through clear "Book a Demo" and "Request Pricing" CTAs

### Background Context

Kryohm currently lacks a professional website that effectively showcases their technical capabilities across their IoT sensing and control portfolio. This gap creates lost sales opportunities, inability to capture qualified leads, and puts them at a competitive disadvantage in the growing IoT/smart infrastructure market. The current state prevents potential B2B customers in agriculture, utilities, property management, and industrial sectors from easily understanding Kryohm's distinct value propositions or engaging with the sales team.

The solution involves building a Next.js 14-powered website that serves as Kryohm's primary lead generation engine while establishing technical credibility. The website must balance technical depth with accessibility, guiding prospects through awareness to consideration to action across three core product lines. This foundation will enable Kryohm to compete effectively with better-established competitors and provide the sales team with the digital presence required for modern B2B engagement.
