# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
As a developer,
I want to initialize the Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and essential dependencies,
so that I have a solid foundation for building the Kryohm website with optimal performance and maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14 project created with App Router architecture and TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS installed and configured with Kryohm brand colors (teal/azure accents)
3. Essential dependencies installed: React Hook Form, next/image optimization, and accessibility tools
4. Project structure organized with /app router, /components, /lib, and /public directories
5. Development environment configured with ESLint, Prettier, and accessibility linting rules
6. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore and basic CI/CD workflow setup
7. Deployment pipeline configured for Vercel or Netlify with automatic deployments

## Dev Notes
- Data model and endpoints are defined for lead submissions; no DB in MVP [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#data-models]
- Form endpoints and route handlers live under `app/api/*/route.ts` [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#backend-architecture]
- Repository structure and directories to follow `components/`, `lib/`, `public/`, `docs/` [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
- Tech stack: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind; hosting on Vercel [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for key flows [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Performance targets and SEO/a11y baselines per DoD [Source: docs/prd.md#definition-of-done-dod]

### Testing
- Unit tests for any starter components
- Verify dev server runs and initial page renders
- Confirm Lighthouse and axe checks baseline pass
