# Story 2.1: Products Hub Page

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a potential customer exploring Kryohm's offerings,
I want to see an overview of all product lines with clear differentiation,
so that I can quickly identify which IoT solutions are most relevant to my business needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Products hub page displays three product categories with distinct visual presentation: Sensors, Prepaid Metering, Shower Control
2. Each product category includes high-level description, key benefits, and primary use cases
3. Visual hierarchy clearly differentiates products while maintaining consistent design language
4. Product category cards include "Learn More" CTAs directing to detailed product pages
5. Comparison table or matrix shows high-level feature differences between product lines
6. Strategic placement of "Book a Demo" and "Request Pricing" CTAs for each product category
7. Page optimized for SEO with proper meta tags and structured data for product categories
8. Mobile-responsive layout ensures clear product differentiation on all device sizes
9. Loading performance meets sub-3-second requirement with optimized product imagery
10. Accessibility compliance with proper heading structure and keyboard navigation between products
