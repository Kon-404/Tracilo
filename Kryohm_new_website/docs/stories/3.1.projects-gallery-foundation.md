# Story 3.1: Projects Gallery Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a potential customer evaluating IoT solutions,
I want to see examples of successful Kryohm implementations across different industries,
so that I can assess their track record and identify similar use cases to my business needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Projects gallery page displays grid layout of case study cards with project thumbnails and brief descriptions
2. Filtering system enables sorting by product type (Sensors, Prepaid Metering, Shower Control) and industry sector
3. Each project card includes: project title, industry, product type, key outcome metric, and "Read Case Study" CTA
4. Search functionality allows finding projects by keyword, industry, or challenge type
5. Gallery supports pagination or infinite scroll for handling multiple case studies efficiently
6. Loading performance optimized with lazy loading and image optimization for project thumbnails
7. Mobile-responsive grid layout ensures easy browsing and filtering on all device sizes
8. SEO optimization with proper meta tags and structured data for project information
9. Strategic lead capture integration: "See Similar Results" or "Discuss Your Project" CTAs
10. Analytics tracking for project views, filter usage, and engagement patterns
11. Accessibility compliance with proper heading structure and keyboard navigation for filtering
12. Integration hooks ready for case study detail pages and cross-referencing from product pages
