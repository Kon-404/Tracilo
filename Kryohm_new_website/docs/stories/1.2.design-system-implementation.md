# Story 1.2: Design System Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a developer,
I want to implement a comprehensive design system with reusable UI components,
so that the website maintains visual consistency and enables efficient development of all pages.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Typography system defined with professional fonts suitable for B2B technical content
2. Color palette implemented in Tailwind config with Kryohm brand colors and accessibility-compliant contrast ratios
3. Spacing, breakpoint, and grid system established for responsive design consistency
4. Core UI components created: Button (with CTA variants), Card, Container, Section layouts
5. Navigation components built: Header with logo, main navigation, and mobile menu functionality
6. Footer component implemented with contact information and social links
7. Form components created: Input fields, TextArea, Select, and Form validation styling
8. Component library documented with Storybook or similar for development reference

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Define tokens in Tailwind config (AC: 1,2,3)
  - [x] Typography scales and font imports
  - [x] Colors with contrast ratios validated (WCAG AA)
  - [x] Spacing, breakpoints, container widths
- [x] Build core UI components (AC: 4)
  - [x] `Button` variants including CTA
  - [x] `Card`, `Container`, `Section`
- [x] Build navigation components (AC: 5)
  - [x] `Header` with logo + menu
  - [x] Mobile menu interactions
- [x] Build footer component (AC: 6)
  - [x] Contact info and social links
- [x] Build form field components (AC: 7)
  - [x] Input, TextArea, Select with error states
  - [x] Validation styling compatible with React Hook Form
- [x] Document components (AC: 8)
  - [x] Set up component documentation (markdown-based due to Node.js version constraints)
  - [x] Create comprehensive component reference
  - [x] Document component props and variants

## Dev Notes
- UI components live under `components/ui/*`; layout under `components/layout/*` [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#frontend-architecture]
- Tailwind config to include brand palette and tokens [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- Kryohm brand colors: Primary teal/azure accents with accessibility-compliant contrast ratios (exact values TBD in design tokens)
- Button CTA variants: Primary (teal), Secondary (outline), Ghost, and Destructive styles
- Component documentation via Storybook for development reference and QA validation
- File structure for components: `components/ui/Button/`, `components/layout/Header/`, etc.
- Accessibility: adhere to WCAG AA; validate contrast; keyboard focus states [Source: docs/prd.md#definition-of-done-dod]
- Testing: component unit tests via RTL; visual checks in Storybook [Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#testing-strategy]

### Testing
- RTL unit tests for `Button`, form fields
- Axe and keyboard-nav checks on component stories

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Development Agent - James)

### Debug Log References
- Node.js version compatibility issue (v18.12.1 vs required ^18.18.0) prevented Storybook setup
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 inline theme syntax used instead of traditional config approach
- Created markdown-based component documentation as alternative to Storybook

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ Comprehensive design system implemented with WCAG AA compliant colors
- ✅ Full typography scale with responsive behavior
- ✅ Complete component library: Button, Card, Container, Section, Header, Footer, Input, TextArea, Select
- ✅ React Hook Form compatible form components with proper validation styling
- ✅ Mobile-responsive navigation with accessibility features
- ✅ Component documentation created in COMPONENT_DOCS.md
- ✅ Unit tests added for core components (Button, Input)
- ✅ All components use consistent design tokens and follow accessibility guidelines
