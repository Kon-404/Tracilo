Ready for Review

## Story
As a website visitor comparing multiple IoT solutions,
I want to easily navigate between different product pages and compare offerings,
so that I can make informed decisions about which Kryohm solutions best meet my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. "Related Products" sections on each page suggest complementary solutions or alternative applications
3. Product comparison functionality allows side-by-side feature and specification comparison
4. Consistent CTA placement and messaging across all product pages for unified lead capture experience
5. Cross-product lead forms intelligently handle multiple product interests and route appropriately
6. Search functionality enables finding specific features or capabilities across all product lines
7. Product page loading optimized with shared components and efficient image loading
8. Analytics tracking implemented for product page performance, engagement, and conversion paths
9. A/B testing framework in place for CTA optimization and conversion rate improvement
10. Mobile experience ensures seamless product exploration and comparison on all devices
11. Accessibility compliance maintained across all product pages with consistent interaction patterns
12. SEO interlinking strategy connects related products and guides search engine understanding
