# Story 4.2: Platform and Integration Overview

## Status
Approved

## Story
As a technical evaluator or system administrator,
I want to understand how Kryohm's platform works and integrates with existing systems,
so that I can assess technical compatibility and implementation requirements for our organization.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Platform architecture overview explains how all three product lines integrate into unified ecosystem
2. Technical specifications detail connectivity options, APIs, and data management capabilities
3. Integration capabilities showcase compatibility with existing business systems and IoT platforms
4. Data flow diagrams illustrate how information moves between sensors, systems, and end users
5. Security and compliance information addresses data protection and industry regulatory requirements
6. Scalability information explains how the platform grows with business needs and additional deployments
7. Dashboard and reporting capabilities highlighted with screenshots or interactive demos
8. Implementation process outlined with typical timelines, phases, and support requirements
9. Technical documentation access provided for API references and integration guides
10. Strategic CTAs for technical engagement: "Platform Demo", "Technical Discussion", "Integration Assessment"
11. SEO optimization targeting platform and integration-related technical keywords
12. Cross-referencing with product pages and case studies demonstrating successful platform implementations
