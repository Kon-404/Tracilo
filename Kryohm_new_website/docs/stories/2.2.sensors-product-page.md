# Story 2.2: Sensors Product Page

## Status
Draft

## Story
As an operations manager in agriculture or industrial sectors,
I want detailed information about Kryohm's IoT sensing solutions,
so that I can evaluate whether these sensors meet my monitoring and data collection requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero section clearly positions sensors value proposition with industry-specific messaging
2. Technical specifications section details sensor types, connectivity options, and measurement capabilities
3. Use cases section showcases applications in agriculture, utilities, and industrial monitoring
4. Benefits section emphasizes ROI, operational efficiency, and data insights
5. Product imagery displays authentic sensor hardware with professional technical photography
6. Integration capabilities explained with platform connectivity and API information
7. Implementation section covers installation requirements, setup process, and support options
8. Strategic CTAs positioned throughout: "Request Sensor Demo", "Get Pricing", "Talk to Specialist"
9. SEO optimization with sensor-related keywords and structured data for product information
10. Cross-references to relevant case studies from Projects section when available
11. Mobile-optimized technical specifications with readable formatting on smaller screens
12. Lead capture forms include sensor-specific qualification questions (monitoring needs, environment, scale)
