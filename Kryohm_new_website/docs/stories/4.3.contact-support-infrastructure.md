so that I can choose the most appropriate engagement method and feel confident about ongoing support.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Contact form includes lead qualification fields: inquiry type, product interest, project timeline, company information
3. Regional contact information for different service areas with local phone numbers and addresses
4. Support information explains technical support availability, response times, and escalation procedures
5. Sales contact routing enables prospects to connect with appropriate specialists by product line or industry
6. Emergency contact information for existing customers requiring urgent technical support
7. Office locations displayed with maps, directions, and professional facility imagery
8. Business hours clearly stated for sales, support, and general inquiries across different time zones
9. Strategic lead capture optimization: prominent "Book a Demo" and "Request Pricing" CTAs
10. Integration with CRM or lead management system for proper routing and follow-up tracking
11. Mobile-optimized contact forms with appropriate input types and validation
12. Accessibility compliance ensuring all contact methods are available to users with disabilities
