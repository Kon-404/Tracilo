# Story 2.3: Prepaid Metering Product Page

## Status  
Ready for Review

## Story
As a utility manager or property administrator,
I want comprehensive information about Kryohm's prepaid metering solutions,
so that I can assess whether this technology can improve our billing efficiency and customer management.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero section positions prepaid metering value proposition for utilities and property management sectors
2. Technical specifications detail meter types, communication protocols, and billing integration capabilities
3. Use cases highlight applications in utilities, residential complexes, and commercial properties
4. Benefits section emphasizes cost savings, reduced manual readings, and improved cash flow management
5. Product imagery showcases actual metering hardware and installation examples
6. Integration section explains compatibility with existing billing systems and software platforms
7. Implementation guidance covers installation process, user training, and ongoing maintenance
8. Strategic CTAs throughout: "Request Metering Demo", "Get Implementation Quote", "Speak with Expert"
9. ROI calculator or cost-benefit information to support purchasing decisions
10. SEO optimization with prepaid metering and utility management keywords
11. Cross-references to utility sector case studies and successful deployments
12. Lead capture forms include metering-specific questions (property type, meter count, current system)
