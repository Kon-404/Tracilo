# Story 4.4: Lead Capture Optimization and Analytics

## Status
Approved

## Story
As a marketing manager tracking website performance,
I want comprehensive analytics and optimized lead capture throughout the site,
so that I can measure conversion effectiveness and continuously improve lead generation results.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Analytics implementation tracks key conversion events: form submissions, demo requests, pricing inquiries
2. Lead scoring system captures qualification data and routes high-value prospects appropriately
3. A/B testing framework enables continuous optimization of CTAs, forms, and conversion elements
4. Heat mapping and user behavior tracking identify optimization opportunities across all pages
5. Conversion funnel analysis tracks user journey from awareness through lead capture
6. Lead source tracking identifies which content and pages drive highest quality conversions
7. Form optimization includes progressive profiling and conditional fields based on user selections
8. Exit-intent popups or similar capture mechanisms for users leaving without converting
9. Thank you pages and confirmation emails provide next steps and additional engagement opportunities
10. Lead nurturing sequences activated based on user behavior and expressed interests
11. Performance dashboards track conversion rates, lead quality, and ROI metrics
12. Integration with marketing automation tools for ongoing lead development and customer journey tracking
