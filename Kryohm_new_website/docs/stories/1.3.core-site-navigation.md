# Story 1.3: Core Site Navigation

## Status
Approved

## Story
As a website visitor,
I want to easily navigate between different sections of the Kryohm website,
so that I can quickly find information about products and services that interest me.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Header navigation displays Kryohm logo and clear menu structure (Home, Products, Platform, Projects, About, Contact)
2. Products dropdown or submenu shows three product categories (Sensors, Prepaid Metering, Shower Control)
3. Mobile-responsive hamburger menu provides full navigation access on smaller screens
4. Active page highlighting shows current location within site navigation
5. Footer navigation includes quick links to key pages and contact information
6. Breadcrumb navigation implemented for deeper pages (product details, case studies)
7. All navigation elements are keyboard accessible and screen reader compatible
8. Navigation persists consistently across all pages with appropriate highlighting
