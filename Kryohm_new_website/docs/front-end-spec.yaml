accessibility:
  standard: WCAG 2.1 AA
  requirements:
    - keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
    - visible focus states (2px outline, 3:1 contrast)
    - form labels and ARIA attributes on inputs
    - color contrast >= 4.5:1 for text; 3:1 for large text/icons
    - semantic headings and landmarks per page

performance:
  budgets:
    lcp_ms: 2500
    cls: 0.1
    tbt_ms: 200
  tactics:
    - next/image with responsive sizes and lazy loading
    - route-level code splitting; dynamic import for heavy modules
    - minimize render-blocking CSS/JS; Tailwind JIT
    - cache headers and CDN via platform

analytics:
  tool: GA4 (baseline)

  consent:
    approach: implied with banner; explicit if required by region

forms:
  validation:
    name: required, min 2 chars
    email: required, email format
    company: required
    phone: optional but formatted
    product_interest: required (options: Sensors, Prepaid Metering, Shower Control, Platform)
    message: required on contact; optional on demo/pricing
    industry/company_size/timeline: required on demo form
  submission:
    method: email service (EmailJS or equivalent) or webhook to CRM

states:
  loading:
    - skeletons for cards and images
  empty:
    - projects list shows helpful empty guidance
  error:
    - inline field errors; global error banner for network issues
  success:
    - friendly confirmation with next steps and contact details

acceptance_criteria:
  - Pages load < 3s on 4G; Lighthouse 95+ mobile and desktop
  - All nav and forms keyboard accessible; a11y audit 95%+
  - CTAs visible above the fold on home and product pages
  - Forms validate with clear errors; submissions reach configured endpoint
  - SEO basics implemented: titles, meta, open graph, structured data
  - Case study list filters work and deep links are shareable

risks:
  - Content delays for product imagery and case studies
  - Performance impact from heavy imagery
  - Integration complexity with CRM/webhooks

open_questions:
  - Which CRM receives leads (e.g., HubSpot, Pipedrive)?
  - Any compliance requirements for target regions (POPIA, GDPR)?
  - Confirm brand color values and typography licensing
  - Which analytics beyond GA4 (conversion tracking, pixels)?

deliverables:
  - Implemented Next.js 14 project with defined routes and components
  - Tailwind config matching brand tokens
  - Reusable form components with validation and submission hooks
  - Documentation for content entry and image specs
