# PRD Shards Index

This directory contains the sharded Product Requirements Document for the Kryohm website. The original overview remains in `../prd.md`. The canonical, execution-ready sections live here.

## Contents

- Governance, Delivery Plan, Compliance, Analytics, DoD: `./governance-plan.md`
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure: `./epic-1-foundation.md`

## Notes

- Update both the shard and the change log in `../prd.md` when a shard changes.
