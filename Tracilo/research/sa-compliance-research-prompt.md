# South African Trade Compliance Research Prompt

## Research Objective

Develop comprehensive understanding of South African compliance requirements, standards, and certification processes for electrical, solar, plumbing, gas, and HVAC installations to ensure Tracilo platform meets all regulatory requirements and generates legally valid documentation.

## Background Context

Tracilo is a cross-platform field operations platform designed for South African trade professionals. The platform's core value proposition is ensuring compliance with South African standards through digital checklists, photo documentation, and automated Certificate of Compliance (COC) generation. Without accurate understanding of regulatory requirements, the platform cannot deliver on its primary value promise.

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **COC Requirements**: What are the specific Certificate of Compliance requirements for each trade (electrical, solar, plumbing, gas, HVAC)?
   - What information must be included on each type of COC?
   - What are the legal requirements for COC issuance and validity?
   - Which professionals are authorized to issue COCs for each trade?

2. **SANS Standards Mapping**: Which SANS (South African National Standards) apply to each trade area?
   - SANS 10142-1 (Electrical installations - Low voltage)
   - SANS 10142-2 (Electrical installations - Medium voltage)
   - SANS 10400 series (Building codes)
   - Other relevant SANS standards for plumbing, gas, HVAC

3. **Digital Documentation Validity**: What are the legal requirements for digital COCs and compliance documentation?
   - Are digital signatures legally recognized?
   - What metadata/audit trail requirements exist?
   - Are there specific formatting or storage requirements?

4. **Inspection Checklists**: What standard inspection and installation checklists exist for each trade?
   - Are there official government or industry association templates?
   - What are the mandatory inspection points for each type of installation?
   - How do inspection requirements vary by installation type and size?

5. **Regulatory Bodies**: Who are the key regulatory authorities and industry bodies for each trade?
   - Department of Employment and Labour (electrical)
   - PIRB (Plumbing Industry Registration Board)
   - SAGAA (South African Gas Appliance Association)
   - Other relevant bodies

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

1. **Regional Variations**: Do compliance requirements vary by province or municipality?
2. **Penalty Framework**: What are the consequences of non-compliance or invalid COCs?
3. **Industry Updates**: How frequently do standards change, and how are updates communicated?
4. **Training Requirements**: What certification/training requirements exist for professionals in each trade?
5. **Digital Transformation**: Are there any government initiatives promoting digital compliance documentation?
