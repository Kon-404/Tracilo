- **Implementation**: Timestamp-based conflict resolution for most field data
- **Use Cases**: Photo metadata, form field values, user preferences
- **Pros**: Simple to implement, works well for field technician workflows
- **Cons**: Potential data loss in rare multi-user scenarios

##### Manual Conflict Resolution - Critical Data
- **Implementation**: User intervention for important compliance data
- **Use Cases**: COC approvals, client signatures, critical test results
- **UI Design**: Clear conflict presentation with side-by-side comparison
- **Fallback**: Escalation to supervisor for complex conflicts

#### Background Sync Implementation

##### Queue Management
```javascript
// Conceptual queue structure
const syncQueue = {
  pending: [
    {
      id: 'uuid',
      type: 'checklist_submission',
      data: { /* checklist data */ },
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      retries: 0,
      priority: 'high'
    }
  ],
  failed: [],
  completed: []
}
```

##### Sync Priority Levels
1. **Critical**: COC submissions, safety violations (immediate sync)
2. **High**: Completed checklists, client signatures (within 5 minutes)

/Documents/
  /images/
    /2025/
      /09/
        /17/
          uuid-original.jpg
          uuid-thumbnail.jpg
          uuid-compressed.jpg
```

### Background Upload Queue

#### Queue Implementation
- **Library**: react-native-background-fetch for OS-optimized scheduling
