# Project Brief: Tracilo

*Generated on September 17, 2025*

## Executive Summary

**Tracilo** is a cross-platform field operations platform designed to standardize installations, inspections, and maintenance for trade professionals. The platform addresses the lack of standardization and compliance tracking in field operations by providing a comprehensive digital solution for electricians, solar installers, plumbers, gas technicians, and HVAC teams. This project aims to create a single source of truth per site through an integrated mobile-first approach with robust administrative oversight.

**Key Value Proposition:** Tracilo provides complete traceability and compliance with South African standards through offline-capable mobile tools and centralized administration, ensuring every installation, callout, and inspection is properly documented and auditable.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Field technicians rely on paper-based checklists and manual documentation processes
- Compliance documentation (like COCs) is often incomplete, lost, or not properly tied to specific sites
- No standardized approach to installations and inspections across different trades
- Limited visibility for management into field operations and work quality
- Difficulty maintaining audit trails and compliance with South African regulatory standards

### Problem Impact
- **Field technicians experience:** Manual paperwork, risk of lost documentation, inconsistent processes across jobs
- **Management impact:** No real-time visibility into field operations, compliance risks, difficulty tracking work history per site
- **Business impact:** Potential regulatory non-compliance, rework due to poor documentation, inefficient operations
- **Client impact:** Lack of transparency into work performed, missing or incomplete compliance certificates

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- **Generic field service apps**: Don't address trade-specific compliance requirements and South African standards
- **Paper-based systems**: Prone to loss, damage, and provide no digital audit trail
- **Basic mobile forms**: Lack offline capabilities and don't integrate with comprehensive site management
- **Industry-specific tools**: Often expensive, complex, or don't handle multi-tenant scenarios effectively

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept
Tracilo consists of three integrated components: a React Native mobile app for offline-first field operations, a React web dashboard for administrative management, and a Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database. The platform enables complete digital transformation of field operations while maintaining compliance with South African standards.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Offline-First Mobile Design:** Field technicians can complete work without internet connectivity, with automatic sync when connection is restored
2. **Trade-Specific Compliance Focus:** Built specifically for South African electrical, solar, plumbing, gas, and HVAC compliance requirements
3. **Site-Centric Architecture:** Every piece of work is tied to a specific site, creating comprehensive site histories
4. **Multi-Tenant Security:** Secure separation between companies while maintaining ease of deployment

### Why This Solution Will Succeed
- **Addresses Real Pain Points**: Built specifically for South African trade compliance requirements, not generic field service
- **Offline-First Approach**: Recognizes reality of field work where internet connectivity is unreliable
- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combines field operations with administrative oversight in a single platform
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modern tech stack allows for growth from startup to enterprise use cases
