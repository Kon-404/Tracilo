# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A professional, field-optimized mobile experience that functions seamlessly in challenging environments (gloves, bright sunlight, poor connectivity) while maintaining the credibility and compliance rigor required for trade professional work. The interface should feel familiar to technicians transitioning from paper workflows while providing clear digital advantages.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-handed operation optimized** for field work with thumb-zone button placement
- **Offline-first interaction patterns** with clear sync status indicators and queue management
- **Progressive disclosure** to reduce cognitive load during complex compliance procedures
- **Error prevention over error correction** with validation prompts and required field enforcement
- **Professional presentation** building user confidence with clean, credible design

## Core Screens and Views
- **Login/Authentication Screen** with professional verification status
- **Job Dashboard** showing active and pending work with offline sync indicators
- **Digital Checklist Interface** with step-by-step compliance workflows
- **Photo Capture & Organization** with automatic metadata and project linking
- **Digital Signature Collection** with client information and professional identification
- **Certificate Generation & Review** with PDF preview and delivery options
- **Settings & Sync Management** for offline operation and data management

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards to ensure usability with work gloves, varying lighting conditions, and different technical skill levels among field technicians.

## Branding
Professional, trustworthy design reflecting South African trade compliance standards. Clean, high-contrast interface suitable for outdoor use with consistent iconography that translates across different trades (electrical, plumbing, gas, solar).

## Target Device and Platforms: Mobile First, Web Responsive
**Primary:** Android mobile (API 26+) optimized for mid-range devices common in South African market
**Secondary:** Web dashboard for operations managers (modern browsers)
