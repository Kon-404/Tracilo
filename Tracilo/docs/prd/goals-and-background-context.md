# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Provide complete traceability and compliance with South African standards through offline-capable mobile tools and centralized administration
• Ensure every installation, callout, and inspection is properly documented and auditable with a single source of truth per site
• Reduce compliance audit failures by 80% through standardized digital documentation processes
• Achieve 95% submission completeness (photos, signatures, all required fields) for all field work
• Enable field technicians to complete full workflows offline with successful sync rates of 99%+
• Deliver sub-2 hour time-to-compliance from work completion to approved COC generation

## Background Context

Tracilo addresses the critical lack of standardization and compliance tracking in South African field operations across electrical, solar, plumbing, gas, and HVAC trades. Currently, field technicians rely on paper-based processes that result in lost documentation, incomplete compliance certificates, and no digital audit trails - creating significant regulatory risks and operational inefficiencies.

The platform combines three integrated components: an offline-first React Native mobile app for field operations, a React web dashboard for administrative management, and a Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database. This architecture specifically addresses the reality of unreliable internet connectivity in field environments while maintaining the comprehensive site-centric documentation required for South African trade compliance standards.
