# Epic 2: Professional Verification Infrastructure

## Epic Goal
Establish the professional verification system that validates trade credentials with South African regulatory bodies (PIRB, SAQCC Gas, Department of Labour), ensuring only qualified professionals can issue Certificates of Compliance through Tracilo.

## Epic Description

**Business Context:**
- Legal requirement: Only verified professionals can issue COCs in South Africa
- Regulatory bodies: PIRB (plumbing), SAQCC Gas (gas installations), Department of Labour (electrical)
- Critical for legal compliance and business credibility
- Prevents unauthorized COC issuance and potential legal liability

**Technical Requirements:**
- Real-time API integration with regulatory body databases
- Manual verification fallback workflows when APIs unavailable
- Periodic re-verification for license renewals
- Role-based permissions based on verified qualifications
- Secure credential storage with encryption

**User Impact:**
- Technicians: Seamless credential verification during onboarding
- Operations Managers: Confidence in team qualifications
- Business Owners: Legal compliance and risk mitigation

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1:** External API Integration Framework
2. **Story 2.2:** PIRB Professional Verification Service
3. **Story 2.3:** SAQCC Gas & DOL Integration Services
4. **Story 2.4:** Manual Verification Workflows
5. **Story 2.5:** Credential Renewal & Monitoring System

## Technical Architecture Alignment

**External API Integrations:**
- PIRB Database API (plumbing professionals)
- SAQCC Gas Database API (gas installation professionals)
- Department of Labour API (electrical professionals)
- Manual verification workflows for API failures

**Key Components:**
- Professional Verification Service
- Credential Caching System (Redis)
- Renewal Monitoring Service
- Role-based Permission System

**Data Security:**
- Encrypted credential storage (SQLCipher)
- API key management and rotation
- Audit trail for all verification attempts
- POPIA compliance for personal data

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Real-time verification with all three regulatory bodies
- ✅ <5 second verification response time for cached credentials
- ✅ 99.5% verification accuracy with manual fallback
- ✅ Automated renewal reminders 30 days before expiry
- ✅ Complete audit trail for compliance purposes
- ✅ Zero unauthorized COC issuance incidents

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies (User Responsibility):**
- PIRB API account setup and credential acquisition
- SAQCC Gas API access registration
- Department of Labour API integration approval
- Legal review of verification workflows

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Epic 1 completion (database and API foundation)
- User management system operational
- Authentication middleware functional

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** External API unavailability blocking user verification
**Mitigation:** Robust manual verification workflows with admin approval
**Rollback Plan:** Disable automatic verification, enable manual-only mode

**Secondary Risk:** API rate limiting during high-volume verification
**Mitigation:** Credential caching, batch verification, queue management
