# Epic 1: Project Foundation & Setup

## Epic Goal
Establish the complete development foundation for Tracilo, including project scaffolding, development environment, core dependencies, and basic infrastructure setup, enabling development teams to begin implementing compliance features efficiently.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**
- Greenfield React Native + Node.js + PostgreSQL application
- Offline-first mobile app for South African trade compliance
- Multi-tenant SaaS with professional verification requirements
- Monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types

**Foundation Requirements:**
- Complete project scaffolding and repository setup
- Development environment configuration for team collaboration
- Core technology stack installation and configuration
- Basic infrastructure setup (database, API foundation)
- Testing framework establishment
- CI/CD pipeline foundation

## Stories

1. **Story 1.1:** Project Scaffolding & Repository Setup
2. **Story 1.2:** Development Environment & Core Dependencies
3. **Story 1.3:** Database & API Foundation Setup
4. **Story 1.4:** Testing Infrastructure & CI/CD Pipeline

## Technical Architecture Alignment

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React Native + TypeScript + Zustand + NativeWind
- Backend: Node.js + Express + tRPC + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
- Testing: Jest + Detox + Supertest
- Build: Turborepo + Metro + Webpack

**Infrastructure:**
- Platform: Vercel + Supabase
- Deployment: Vercel Edge Functions, Supabase PostgreSQL
- Monitoring: Sentry

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Complete monorepo structure established
- ✅ All team members can run development environment locally
- ✅ Core API endpoints functional with database connectivity
- ✅ Testing frameworks operational with sample tests
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline deploying to staging environment
- ✅ Team can begin implementing Epic 2 immediately

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Vercel account setup (User responsibility)
- Supabase account setup (User responsibility)
- GitHub repository creation (User responsibility)

**Internal Dependencies:**
- None (This is the foundational epic)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Complex monorepo setup causing development delays
**Mitigation:** Use proven Turborepo patterns, incremental setup validation
**Rollback Plan:** Revert to simpler structure if monorepo proves problematic

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Development environment setup documentation complete
- [ ] All team members can run project locally
- [ ] Basic smoke tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] Ready for Epic 2 professional verification development
