# Story 3.3: Compliance Photo Documentation System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** field technician,
**I want** an integrated photo documentation system that captures compliance evidence with automatic metadata,
**so that** I can provide comprehensive visual proof of installations and inspections for regulatory compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Integrated Photo Capture:** Seamless camera integration within checklist forms with context-aware photo prompts
2. **Automatic Metadata Collection:** GPS coordinates, timestamp, device information, and checklist context automatically captured with each photo
3. **Photo Organization:** Systematic organization by project, section, and field with searchable metadata and tags
4. **Image Optimization:** Automatic compression, thumbnail generation, and multiple resolution storage for performance
5. **Offline Photo Management:** Complete offline photo capture, storage, and organization with background sync queuing
6. **Compliance Annotation:** Photo markup tools for highlighting compliance points and adding contextual annotations

    questionText: string;
  };
  annotations?: PhotoAnnotation[];
}

interface PhotoAnnotation {
  id: string;
  type: 'arrow' | 'circle' | 'text' | 'highlight';
  coordinates: { x: number; y: number };
  content?: string;
  style: AnnotationStyle;
}
```
