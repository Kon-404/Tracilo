## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** field technician,
**I want** an intuitive mobile interface for completing checklists with complete offline functionality,
**so that** I can perform inspections and complete compliance documentation regardless of network connectivity.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 provides the SANS-compliant template engine and dynamic form system that this story builds upon to create the mobile interface and offline capabilities.

### Data Models
From Architecture Document (architecture.md#data-models):

**Checklist Mobile Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface Checklist {
  id: string;
  siteId: string;
  templateId: string;
  technicianId: string;
  supervisorId?: string;
  status: ChecklistStatus;
  formData: Record<string, any>;
  photos: Photo[];
  signatures: DigitalSignature[];
  startedAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  approvedAt?: Date;
  syncStatus: 'pending' | 'synced' | 'conflict';
  lastModified: Date;
}

interface ChecklistDraft {
  id: string;
  templateId: string;
  siteId: string;
  partialFormData: Record<string, any>;
  lastSaved: Date;
  progress: {
    completedSections: string[];
    totalSections: number;
    completionPercentage: number;
  };
}
```
