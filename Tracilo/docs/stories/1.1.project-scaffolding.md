# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Repository Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team member,
**I want** a complete monorepo project structure with initial configuration,
**so that** I can efficiently develop React Native mobile app, web dashboard, and backend API with shared types and consistent tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Monorepo Structure:** Complete Turborepo monorepo structure established with apps/ and packages/ organization
2. **Package Configuration:** All package.json files configured with proper dependencies and scripts
3. **TypeScript Setup:** Shared TypeScript configuration across all packages with strict typing enabled
4. **Environment Setup:** Environment variable templates and configuration files for all environments
5. **Initial Documentation:** README files with setup instructions and project structure explanation
6. **Git Configuration:** Repository initialized with proper .gitignore, commit hooks, and branch protection
