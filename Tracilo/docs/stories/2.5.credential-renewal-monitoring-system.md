# Story 2.5: Credential Renewal & Monitoring System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** operations manager,
**I want** automated monitoring and renewal management for all professional credentials,
**so that** I can proactively manage team qualifications and prevent work interruptions from expired licenses.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Automated Renewal Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of professional credential expiry dates with 30, 14, and 7-day advance notifications
2. **Renewal Workflow Management:** Streamlined renewal process tracking with document management and approval workflows

4. **Team Qualification Dashboard:** Comprehensive dashboard showing team-wide credential status, upcoming renewals, and compliance risks
5. **Automatic Re-verification:** Scheduled re-verification with regulatory APIs to detect status changes and updates
6. **Compliance Risk Prevention:** Automatic work restrictions and COC generation blocking for professionals with expired credentials
