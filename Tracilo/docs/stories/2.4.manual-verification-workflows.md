# Story 2.4: Manual Verification Workflows

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** operations manager,
**I want** comprehensive manual verification workflows as fallback when regulatory APIs are unavailable,
**so that** professional credential verification continues without interruption and business operations remain compliant.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Manual Override Interface:** Web dashboard interface for managers to manually verify professional credentials when APIs fail
2. **Document Upload System:** Secure document upload and storage for manual verification evidence (certificates, licenses)
3. **Approval Workflow:** Multi-step approval process with supervisor review and compliance validation for manual verifications
4. **Temporary Authorization:** Time-limited professional authorization while awaiting full verification completion
5. **Audit Trail Enhancement:** Enhanced audit logging for manual verifications with document tracking and approval chains
6. **API Fallback Logic:** Automatic fallback to manual workflows when APIs are unavailable with proper notification

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1-2.3 provide the API integration framework and regulatory body integrations that this story provides fallback workflows for when those APIs are unavailable.

### Data Models
From Architecture Document (architecture.md#data-models):

**Manual Verification Extensions:**
```typescript
interface ManualVerification {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  organizationId: string;
  tradeType: 'electrical' | 'solar' | 'plumbing' | 'gas' | 'hvac';
  registrationNumber: string;
  issuingBody: 'PIRB' | 'SAQCC_GAS' | 'DOL' | 'ECSA';
  status: 'pending' | 'under_review' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'temporary';
  documents: VerificationDocument[];
  approvalChain: ApprovalStep[];
  temporaryExpiry?: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface VerificationDocument {
  id: string;
  type: 'license' | 'certificate' | 'id_document' | 'supporting';
  fileName: string;
  fileSize: number;
  mimeType: string;
  storageUrl: string;
  uploadedAt: Date;
  uploadedBy: string;
}

interface ApprovalStep {
  stepNumber: number;
  assignedTo: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  decision?: 'approve' | 'reject';
  reasoning?: string;
  processedAt?: Date;
  processedBy?: string;
}
```
